        <h2> What is a yurt? </h2>
             Our luxury yurts are permament structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is
            <br> fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor and a roof dome that can be
            <br> opened.
        <h2> How are yurts furnished? </h2>
             Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
            <br> Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
            <br> running water. Shower and restroom facities are located in the lodge.
        <h2> What should I bring? </h2>
             Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
            <br> weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
            <br> sense of adventure!
